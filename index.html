<left><font color="#202020"> As you probably guessed, that is me in the image above. I am a Williamsville North graduate and am currently enrolled at the University at Buffalo.</font></left>
<left> <font color="#202020">My intended major at this school is computer science and I am enjoying the program very much.</font></left>
<left> <font color="#202020">Originally however, I had planned to major in Marine biology but after I realized the lack of jobs in the field I quickly switched to computer science.</font></left>

<FONT SIZE="4"><Center>Outside of school I have multiple hobbies and interests that keep me busy in my spare time. Here are some of them: </Center></FONT>

		<TD><CENTER> Hockey was the first sport I ever played. Although I'm not on a team anymore me and my friends still play pond-hockey during winter at my house.</Center></TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD><CENTER> The Next sport and the one that I stuck with was swimming. I started as a distance swimmer in High School and finished as a sectionals finalist by senior year</CENTER></TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD><CENTER> As far as hobbies go, fishing is a big one as you could guess from my picture. Along the lines of that I also keep several aquariums.</center></TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD><CENTER> Lastly, my other hobby is gaming. Not very productive, I know, but its very fun for me. I sometimes livestream what I'm playing to a website called twitch. You can find my channel here: <A HREF="https://www.twitch.tv/that_rather_average_gamer">https://www.twitch.tv/that_rather_average_gamer</a>
			My twitch page is my larger contribution to the internet, this webpage being my other. I've been active on twitch for around 2 years and have a small follower group of around 140. I have a schedule and sometimes reach out to other people in community to stream with.
			It's a fun way to be a part of the internet.</CENTER></TD>
